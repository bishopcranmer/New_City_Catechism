The "New City Catechism" was devised by Timothy Keller and Sam Shammas of Redeemer Presbyterian Church and the Gospel Coalition.

A manageable compilation of reformation period catechisms (especially the "Heidelberg Catechism"), the work is intended to address the all too common "superficial smatterings of truth, blurry notions about God and godliness, and thoughtlessness about the issues of living — career-wise, community-wise, family-wise, and church-wise — which are all too often the marks of evangelical congregations today …" ("Grounded in the Gospel: Building Believers the Old-Fashioned Way", Parret & Packer).

St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church in Willow Grove, PA has reprinted this helpful work of 52 questions and answers — one for each week of the year — for its own use and offers it to the public for the cost of printing.
