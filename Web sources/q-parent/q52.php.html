		<h2>Revelation 21:1–4</h2>
		<div class="niv">
		  <p>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p>

And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.

		<h2>Commentary</h2>
		<p>Scripture begins with the original creation of the universe and ends in its last chapters with the creation of a new universe. And in between, the perspective is overshadowed by this Alpha and Omega, this Beginning and End. The first outspoken expression of this is God’s word in Isaiah 65: "Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth" (v.17). Then Jesus himself spoke of the <i>palingenesia</i>, literally ‘the new birth,’ but translated by the NIV "the renewal of all things" (Matt. 19:28). In the rest of the New Testament the three major apostolic authors (Paul, Peter, and John) all allude to the same theme. Paul writes that the whole creation will one day be liberated from its bondage to pain and decay (Rom. 8:18–25). Peter prophesies that the present heavens will be replaced by a new heaven and earth, which will be the home of righteousness and peace (2 Pet. 3:7–13). Next, John writes that he saw the same replacement, together with the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God (Rev. 21:1–2). And in the same chapter John writes that the kings of the earth and the nations will bring their glory into the city, though "nothing impure will ever enter into it" (Rev. 21:27). We need to be cautious in our interpretation of these verses, but they seem to mean that human culture will not all be destroyed but, once purged of every taint of evil, will be preserved to beautify the New Jerusalem. To sum up, just as in the resurrection of the body, so in the renewal of the universe, the old will not all be destroyed but will be transformed. This is our living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>

		<h2>Prayer</h2>
		<p>And now to Him who purchased the church with his own blood, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, and exercises a tender care over the weakest and meanest of his flock;—to Him…do I now desire to devote my strength, my life, my all; to be employed how, and as long, as his unerring wisdom shall direct and appoint. And the Lord grant! that I may obtain mercy to be found faithful…. And as it is in Him I desire to be found, at the last, the universal audit; so it is in his name I humbly go forth…. Oh my God! my adored Redeemer! my infinite, eternal All! Let my own soul…be ever precious in thy sight! And grant, that after the exercise of much fervent, mutual love, and the enjoyment of many spiritual comforts, in these thy lower courts; we may finally arrive at those blissful regions, where love is perfect, and joy perpetual; where hymns of holy wonder, and songs of devoutest praise, shall be our uninterrupted and everlasting employ! Amen and Amen.</p>
